Services are another method of communication for nodes in the ROS graph. Services are based on a call-and-response model versus the publisher-subscriber model of topics. While topics allow nodes to subscribe to data streams and get continual updates, services only provide data when they are specifically called by a client.

With ROS 2 services, one or many "client" nodes can make requests to a "server" node and wait for its response. These make services great for performing on-demand tasks â€“ like performing on-the-fly computations or simple one-time tasks.
