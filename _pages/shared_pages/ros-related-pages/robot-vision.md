Color Conversion with OpenCV: HSV and CIELAB
OpenCV provides powerful tools for color space conversions, allowing us to manipulate images more effectively by focusing on specific color ranges. Here’s how you can use OpenCV to work with HSV and CIELAB color spaces:

HSV Color Space
The HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space is often used in computer vision for its ability to separate chromatic content (color) from intensity. Below is an example of how to convert an image from BGR (Blue, Green, Red) to HSV and isolate a specific color range:

```python
import cv2 as cv
import numpy as np

# Convert BGR to HSV
hsv = cv.cvtColor(frame, cv.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

# Define the range for the blue color in HSV
lower_blue = np.array([110, 50, 50])
upper_blue = np.array([130, 255, 255])

# Create a mask to keep only the blue colors within the specified range
mask = cv.inRange(hsv, lower_blue, upper_blue)
``` 

CIELAB Color Space
CIELAB is a color space that aims to be perceptually uniform, meaning the same amount of numeric change corresponds to about the same amount of visually perceived change. OpenCV represents the CIELAB color space as L*, a*, and b* channels:

L (Lightness):* 0 to 255
a (Green to Red):* 42 to 226
b (Blue to Yellow):* 20 to 223
Here’s how to convert an image from BGR to CIELAB using OpenCV:

```python
import cv2 as cv

# Convert BGR to CIELAB
lab = cv.cvtColor(frame, cv.COLOR_BGR2LAB)
```

By converting RGB colors to CIELAB in OpenCV, you can work within the ranges:

L*: 0 to 255
a*: 42 to 226
b*: 20 to 223
