In this assignment you will work with the code example with KerasCV in Google Collab found here:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/keras-team/keras-io/blob/master/guides/ipynb/keras_cv/object_detection_keras_cv.ipynb

You will explore how well this pretrained YOLO network can detect images of cats and dogs on the walls of a virtual environment in Gazebo, from the point of view of the Turtlebot robot. You will work with a teleoperated Turtlebot in a simulated environment. The robot is equipped with a camera that provides a stream of images to a ```'/camera/image_raw'``` topic. 

Your task is TODO.
